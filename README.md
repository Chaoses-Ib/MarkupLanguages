# Markup Languages
**Markup** refers to data included in an electronic document which is distinct from the document's content in that it is typically not included in representations of the document for end users. Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.[^wiki]

A **markup language** is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs.[^wiki]
