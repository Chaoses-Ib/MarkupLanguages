# Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.[^wiki]

[^wiki]: [Markdown - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

## Variants
- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

  A standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations against this specification.

  - [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

    Strict superset of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists, which GFM adds as extensions.
